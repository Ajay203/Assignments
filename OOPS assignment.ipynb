What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\nAns - > Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.\nIn Python everythings is considered as as object.Object-oriented programming in python is paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n\nQ2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\nAns ->  An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, then in the class the instance was created from, then in all higher superclasses, progressing from left to right (by default). The search stops at the first place the attribute is found.\n\nQ3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\nAns -> The objects created inside a class is known as class instance while if the object is created inside an instance with a value that can be passed inside the class is known as instance object.\n\nQ4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\nAns -> self represents the first argument of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n\nQ5. What is the purpose of the init method?\nAns -> The init method is used in the constructor of the class object.\nThe init method is used to initiate the class object.All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.The __init__() function helps to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created\n\nQ6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\nAns -> variable_name = class_name(Arguments) \n\nQ7. What is the process for creating a class?\nAns ->\nclass class_name :\n    #constructor\n    def __init__(self , arguments):\n        self.argument = argument\n\n    #class function\n    def function_name (self) :\n        function_codes\n\nQ8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\nAns -> The class from which another class inherits its functions are called as the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class.\n\nQ9. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\nAns -> Classes in python are templates for creating objects. They contain variables and functions which define the class objects. At the same time, modules are python programs that can be imported into another python program. Importing a module enables the usage of the module’s functions and variables into another program\n\nQ10. How do you make instances and classes?\nAns -> Classes are made when we declare a class with its keyword \"class classname :\" whereas instances don't have any keyword.\nThey just have the variable and the value of the attributes that will be passed into the class for the desired function to happen.\n\nQ11. Where and how should be class attributes created?\nAns -> Class Attributes are unique to each class. Each instance of the class will have this attribute. It’s sometimes used to specify a default value that all objects should have after they’ve been instantiated. Here, our class attribute is species\n\nclass Dog:\n\n    species = 'mammal'\n\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n\nQ12. Where and how are instance attributes created ?\nAns -> Instance Attributes are unique to each object, (an instance is another name for an object). Here, any Dog object we create will be able to store its name and age. We can change either attribute of either dog, without affecting any other dog objects we’ve created.\n\nclass Dog:\n\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\nQ13. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\nAns -> The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.It does not have to be named self , we can call it whatever we like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class.\n\nQ14. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\nAns -> To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function or magic function that is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator. For example, when we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined.\n\nQ15. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\nAns -> Consider that we have two objects which are a physical representation of a class (user-defined data type) and we have to add two objects with add '+' operator it throws an error, because compiler don't know how to add two objects. So we define a method for an operator and that process is called operator overloading.\n\nQ16. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\nAns -> A very popular example of operator overloading is the Addition (+) operator. This single '+' operator operates on two numbers and the same operator operates on two strings. It performs “Addition” on numbers whereas it performs “Concatenation” on strings.\n\nQ17. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\nAns -> Classes and Objects are 2 of the most inportant concepts to grasp for OOP in python.\n\nQ18. Describe three applications for exception processing.\nAns ->Raised when the specified key is not found in the dictionary. \nRaised when an identifier is not found in the local or global namespace. \nRaised when trying to access a local variable in a function or method but no value has been assigned to it\n\nQ19. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\nAns ->When an exception occurred, if you don't handle it, the program terminates abruptly and the code past the line that caused the exception will not get executed.\n\nQ20. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\nAns -> We can provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception. After the except clause(s), we can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception. \n\nQ21. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\nAns -> There are two methods to handle Python exceptions: Try – This method catches the exceptions raised by the program. Raise – Triggers an exception manually using custom exceptions\n\nQ22. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of\nwhether or not an exception exists.\nAns ->\n\nQ23. What is the purpose of the try statement?\nAns -> The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.\n\nQ24. What are the two most popular try statement variations?\nAns -> Try-Except - Try and Except statement is used to handle these errors within our code in Python. The try block is used to check some code for errors i.e the code inside the try block will execute when there is no error in the program. Whereas the code inside the except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceding try block.\nTry-Finally - Here the Finally block will run itself even if the code in try block raises an error.\n\n\nQ25. What is the purpose of the raise statement?\nAns ->Python raise Keyword is used to raise exceptions or errors. The raise keyword raises an error and stops the control flow of the program. It is used to bring up the current exception in an exception handler so that it can be handled further up the call stack.\n\nQ26. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?\nAns -> Assertions are statements that assert or state a fact confidently in the program. Assertions are simply boolean expressions that check if the conditions return true or not. If it is true, the program does nothing and moves to the next line of code. However, if it's false, the program stops and throws an error.\n\nQ27. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\nAns ->The with statement is a replacement for commonly used try/finally error-handling statements. A common example of using the with statement is opening a file.The with statement automatically closes the file after we have completed writing it.\n\nQ28. What are *args, **kwargs?\nAns -> *args and **kwargs are keywords in python which is used when we are unsureof the number of arguments that will be passed in a function.\n*args allows us to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a Python function.*args convert the the values into tuples.\n**kwargs allows us to pass a variable of keyword arguments to a python function.**kwargs convert the values into key:value pair in a dictionary.\n\nQ29. How can I pass optional or keyword parameters from one function to another?\nAns -> There are two main ways to pass optional parameters in python \n- Without using keyword arguments.\n- By using keyword arguments.\n\nQ30. What are Lambda Functions?\nAns -> Lambda functions are small functions that we can declare in python. Lambda function can take n number of arguments but it can only have one expression at a time.Python Lambda Functions are anonymous function means that the function is without a name. As we already know that the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python. \n\nQ31. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?\nAns -> Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n\nQ32. Suppose class C inherits from classes A and B as class C(A,B).Classes A and B both have their own versions of method func(). If we call func() from an object of class C, which version gets invoked?\nAns ->The func() from Class B will be invoked because this is the latest function passed in class C.\n\nQ33. Which methods/functions do we use to determine the type of instance and inheritance?\nAns -> isinstance() and issubclass() - The isinstance() method checks whether an object is an instance of a class whereas issubclass() method asks whether one class is a subclass of another class (or other classes).\nisinstance(object, classinfo) - Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof.\nissubclass(class, classinfo) - Return true if class is a subclass (direct, indirect or virtual) of classinfo. A class is considered a subclass of itself.\n\nQ34.Explain the use of the 'nonlocal' keyword in Python.\nAns -> The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside nested functions, where the variable should not belong to the inner function.\nUse the keyword nonlocal to declare that the variable is not local.\n\nQ35. What is the global keyword?\nAns -> A keyword which can be used anywhere in the program even if it is declared from inside a function is known as a global keyword.\nUsing Global as a prefix before the keyword helps us to convert the local keyword into Global Keyword.\nThis global keyword can be used anywhere in the program.\n\"\"\"",
